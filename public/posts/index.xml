      <description>How shall I go about writing about the very first Manga I have read? I think best to start with my very first impressions.
1. The crime I didn&amp;rsquo;t think Japan had so much crime. US yes, India of course. But I had a completely different picture of Japan in my mind from conversations with friends who live there and reading about people&amp;rsquo;s experiences on Quora. Though I think the reality might be that Japanese people like to read about it but don&amp;rsquo;t tend to do any such things.</description>

      <description>Sunday brunch is always on my mind and we decided to go specially since my parents are in town. But what with A&amp;rsquo;s swim class and a slow morning for everyone else, we could only get out the door in time for lunch.
I decided on a restaurant but after a quick online perusal of their menu, I could hardly see any vegetarian options. My parents are vegetarian and there is a dearth of vegetarian menu options in Jakarta.</description>
